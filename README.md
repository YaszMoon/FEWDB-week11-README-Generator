# FEWDB-week11-README-Generator

## Description

Challenge for Week 11 of the Skills for Life Front End Web Development Bootcamp

## User Story

**AS A** developer
**I WANT** a README generator
**SO THAT** I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create a command-line application that accepts user input.

- When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

  - The title of the project

  - Description

  - Table of Contents (if necessary)

  - License

  - Questions

  - Other Selected Sections

- When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

- When a user enters a description, questions and other section information it is displayed with the relevant headings.

- When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

- When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

- When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

- When a user adds more than two optional sections a Table of Contents is generated.
  - When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
